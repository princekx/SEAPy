The compile using GNU compilers relies on the sincos builtin, however, on some machines this does not exist it
seems, e.g. MACOS-X. This causes a problem for the utils program compilation. To get around this in utils copy the
file makelinks.csh.sincos to makelinks.csh and in the utils sub-directories where a Makefile.sincos exists copy
this to Makefile. 

Another option would be to use -fno-builtin-sincos
